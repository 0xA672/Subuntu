Welcome to Subuntu! We can help you quickly set up a full-stack development environment!  
If you’re trying this for the first time, don’t worry—just follow the steps we’ve listed below!  

First, clone our repository!!  
`git clone https://github.com/0xA672/Subuntu.git  `

Switch to the Subuntu directory you just (maybe?) pulled down locally!!  
`cd Subuntu ` 

Give the script a little ~permission~ (so it can help you download stuff)  
`chmod +x ss.sh ` 

Alright, now run!!!(it's might you should enter password)                                                                                                             
`./ss.sh`

If you find our tool useful, could you give us a star? Kiss you!!
